# ABSTRACT
Summing up and summarizing are two terms which are becoming increasingly common in all 
areas of activity, in which summing up is in fact compressing a text in the best possible way, 
while summarizing is listing important topics arising from it. So, it has become even more 
important to understand the techniques which are able to make both efficient. In view of this 
reality, this paper intends to present the RO (Read Optimizer) software in a theoretical and 
practical way, demonstrating how much time can be saved in the reading process when 
summing up or summarizing, and, of course, without devaluing the quality of the process. In 
this way, the document in focus is based on the specification of the development stages, from 
the emergence of the idea and benchmarking to the user experience in using the program in a 
first version. It is also important to emphasize which Read Optimizer does not produce the 
resume of a text itself, but rather acts as a support and guidance tool. Thus, it was verified that 
although there are other applications supported by the same precepts, there are at RO, 
particularities and advantages when it comes to valuing the margin of interpretation by the user. 
Finally, considering this evidence, one can conclude that for those who are looking for 
something more direct, which performs a synthesis in an immediate and totally computerized 
way, what already exists on the market can satisfy, but understanding the existence of those 
who need greater precision in comprehension, there is the system developed here.
